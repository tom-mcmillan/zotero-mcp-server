4. **Analyze methods**: "What methodologies are used in real estate climate studies?"
5. **Identify gaps**: "What research gaps exist in climate real estate research?"

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "I'm researching climate impacts on real estate. What's available?"

Claude: [Uses get_collection_overview] "The collection contains 352 papers 
with significant coverage of real estate climate impacts..."

You: "Show me specific real estate climate studies"

Claude: [Uses search_research] "I found 45 papers on real estate climate 
risk, including studies on commercial properties, residential markets..."

You: "What methodologies do these studies use?"

Claude: [Uses get_methodologies] "The real estate climate studies use 
diverse approaches: hedonic pricing models, difference-in-differences..."
```
